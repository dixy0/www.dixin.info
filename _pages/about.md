My name is 邸新. My given name, 新 (Xin), means **new** in Chinese.  

I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology ([NJIT](https://people.njit.edu/faculty/dixin)). My research interest is mainly on understanding brain connectivity and brain network organizations using brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Click [here](https://www.dixin.info/research/) for details about my research.

For more information, see my [CV](https://www.dixin.info/files/CV_XinDi.pdf). 

## Current projects
* Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder

This is a NIH funded project to study the developments of brain dynamic and stable connectivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and typically developing controls. Undergraduate research opportunities are available. Please contact me if you are interested.
