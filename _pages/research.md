### 1. Brain functional connectivity during movie watching
Method developments to study dynamic connectivity and individual differences during movie watching.  
* [Dynamic and stationary brain connectivity during movie watching as revealed by functional MRI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-022-02522-w) in Brain Struct Funct.
* [Principal component analysis reveals multiple consistent responses to naturalistic stimuli in children and adults](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25568) in Hum Brain Mapp.
* [Intersubject consistent dynamic connectivity during natural vision revealed by functional MRI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116698) in Neuroimage.

### 2. Brain functional connectivity in different task conditions
We are interested in how do brain connectivity and brain network organizations change between different different conditions, e.g. resting-state, task performance, and waching movies. 
* [Toward Task Connectomics: Examining Whole-Brain Task Modulated Connectivity in Different Task Domains](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy055) in Cereb Cortex.
* [Task-modulated brain connectivity of the amygdala: a meta-analysis of psychophysiological interactions](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-016-1239-4) in Brain Struct Funct.
* [Task vs. Rest - Different Network Configurations between the Coactivation and the Resting-State Brain Networks](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00493) in Front Hum Neurosci.

### 3. Method developments for studying task related connectivity
Method developments on methods for studying task related connectivity, including psychophysiological interaction (PPI), beta series, sliding window, and intersubject correlation methods on both conventional task data and naturalistic task data.
* [Understanding psychophysiological interaction and its relations to beta series correlation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-020-00304-8) in Brain Imaging Behav.
* [Toward Task Connectomics: Examining Whole-Brain Task Modulated Connectivity in Different Task Domains](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy055) in Cereb Cortex. 
* [Psychophysiological Interactions in a Visual Checkerboard Task: Reproducibility, Reliability, and the Effects of Deconvolution](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00573) in Front Neurosci.
* [Imperfect (de)convolution may introduce spurious psychophysiological interactions and how to avoid it](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23413) in Hum Brain Mapp.  
* [Task-related Functional Connectivity Dynamics in a Block-designed Visual Experiment](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00543) in Front Hum Neurosci.

### 4. Brain functional connectivity modulated by other regions
This line of researches focuses on how brain connectivity between two brain regions is modulated by a third region.
* [Anterior cingulate cortex differently modulates fronto-parietal functional connectivity between resting-state and working memory tasks](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24912) in Hum Brain Mapp.
* [Characterizations of resting-state modulatory interactions in human brain](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00893.2014) in J Neurophysiol.
* [Dynamic Brain Functional Connectivity Modulated by Resting-State Networks](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0634-3) in Brain Structure and Function.
* [Modulatory Interactions between the Default Mode Network and Task Positive Networks in Resting-State](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.367) in PeerJ.
* [Modulatory interactions of resting-state brain functional connectivity](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071163) in PLoS ONE.


### 5. Brain metabolic connectivity and networks
This line of research focuses on brain metabolic connectivity as measured by FDG-PET.
* [Interregional causal influences of brain metabolic activity reveal the spread of aging effects during normal aging](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24728) in Human Brain Mapping.
* [Do all roads lead to Rome? A comparison of brain networks derived from inter-subject volumetric and metabolic covariance and moment-to-moment hemodynamic correlations in old individuals](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-017-1438-7) in Brain Struct Funct.
* [Metabolic Brain Covariant Networks as Revealed by FDG-PET with reference to resting-state fMRI networks](https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2012.0086) in Brain Connect.
