## Research areas
### 1. Brain alterations in autism spectrum disorder
I am interested in understanding the brain mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder. Related publications:  
* [Disrupted focal white matter integrity in autism spectrum disorder: a voxel-based meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging studies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.11.007) 
* [Similarly expanded bilateral temporal lobe volumes in female and male children with autism spectrum disorder](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2015.11.006)

### 2. Brain functional connectivity during movie watching
I develop novel methods to study brain dynamic connectivity during natrualistic experiments, e.g., movie watching. Related publications: 
* [Individual differences in time-varying and stationary brain connectivity during movie watching from childhood to early adulthood: age, sex, and behavioral associations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2023.101280)
* [Dynamic and stationary brain connectivity during movie watching as revealed by functional MRI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-022-02522-w)
* [Principal component analysis reveals multiple consistent responses to naturalistic stimuli in children and adults](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25568)

### 3. Brain functional connectivity in different task conditions
I am interested in how brain connectivity and network organization change under different conditions, such as resting-state, task performance, and watching movies. I develop methods for studying task-related connectivity, including psychophysiological interaction (PPI), beta series, sliding window, and intersubject correlation methods on both conventional task data and naturalistic task data. Related publications:
* [Toward Task Connectomics: Examining Whole-Brain Task Modulated Connectivity in Different Task Domains](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy055)
* [Imperfect (de)convolution may introduce spurious psychophysiological interactions and how to avoid it](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23413)
* [Task vs. Rest - Different Network Configurations between the Coactivation and the Resting-State Brain Networks](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00493)

### 4. Brain functional connectivity modulated by other regions
This line of researches focuses on how brain connectivity between two brain regions is modulated by a third region. Related publications: 
* [Anterior cingulate cortex differently modulates fronto-parietal functional connectivity between resting-state and working memory tasks](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24912) 
* [Characterizations of resting-state modulatory interactions in human brain](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00893.2014) 
* [Modulatory Interactions between the Default Mode Network and Task Positive Networks in Resting-State](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.367)

### 5. Brain metabolic connectivity and molecular connectivity
This line of research focuses on brain metabolic connectivity as measured by FDG-PET. Related publications: 
* [Interregional causal influences of brain metabolic activity reveal the spread of aging effects during normal aging](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24728) 
* [Do all roads lead to Rome? A comparison of brain networks derived from inter-subject volumetric and metabolic covariance and moment-to-moment hemodynamic correlations in old individuals](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-017-1438-7) 
* [Metabolic Brain Covariant Networks as Revealed by FDG-PET with reference to resting-state fMRI networks](https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2012.0086)
