## Research topics

### 1. Brain functional connectivity in different task conditions
We are interested in how do brain connectivity and brain network organizations change between different different conditions, e.g. resting-state, task performance, and waching movies.

### 2. Method developments for studying task related connectivity
Method developments on methods for studying task related connectivity, including psychophysiological interaction (PPI), beta series, sliding window, and intersubject correlation methods on both conventional task data and naturalistic task data.

### 3. Brain functional connectivity modulated by other regions
This line of researches focuses on how brain connectivity between two brain regions is modulated by a third region.
